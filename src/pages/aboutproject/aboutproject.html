	<b>(TO BE VISITED DURING THE CENTENNIAL TRIP)</b>
	 <b>THE CHW TERRY SCHWARZFELD (OTTAWA) DAYCARE</b>
	 <p class="about_desc">
	 The Terry Schwarzfeld (Ottawa) Daycare, located in Akko, opened in 1964, and is one of six daycares that CHW supports in Israel. Currently, the daycare provides daily care for more than 70 children, in three classrooms. The children come from a variety of backgrounds. Due to the daycare's unique location, it caters to children who are Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, and is a model of coexistence. Some of the children arrive at the daycare through a welfare referral program, as their families are in desperate need of this assistance. The daycare has a dedicated and well-trained staff of twelve who provide guidance and care to the children in a nurturing and enriching environment. 

The Terry Schwarzfeld (Ottawa) Daycare also provides home support services. A team of professionals –  a psychologist, an occupational therapist, and speech therapist – works individually with children who have learning disabilities and/or behavioral issues, as well as with their families. The team assists with cognitive, motor, emotional, and psychological issues. Treatment plans are established with the goal of ensuring a brighter future for each child.

CHW has supported many renovations and programs at the daycare. The kitchen was renovated so that both kosher meat and dairy meals can be prepared for the children, ensuring a healthy and balanced diet. The WIZ Kids Program, where children have access to both computers and tablets, provides instruction and a hands on learning experience. The playgrounds have been renovated to ensure a safe outdoor play environment for the children.

 <h3>CHW NAHALAL YOUTH VILLAGE</h3>
 <p class="about_desc">
CHW Nahalal Youth Village, located on Moshav Nahalal in the Jezreel Valley in Northern Israel, was founded in 1923 as an agricultural school for Eastern European immigrant women. In the 1940s, CHW Nahalal Youth Village became a co- educational high school. Currently, CHW Nahalal serves 1,421 students in grades 7 to 12, who live nearby, or in residential dormitories on campus. 
There are over 330 children living in the dormitories. These students come from all over Israel, as their families are unable to protect and care for them. Many have experienced emotional, sexual and physical abuse. Others are new immigrant students who have arrived in Israel without their parents. Local students attend school with those in the residential program. 
CHW Nahalal is home to the Na'aleh and Anieres Programs. Currently, there are over 100 children taking part in these programs. The Na'aleh Program, which in Hebrew, means "Youth Aliyah Before the Parents," is designed to absorb and integrate children from the former Soviet Union into life both at CHW Nahalal and in Israel. These students live in dormitories, receive a high quality education, and have access to unique learning opportunities. The Anieres Program is offered to both Israeli children and those from abroad. This specialized program is aimed at supporting children from low socio-economic backgrounds who are extremely gifted academically. It is a scholarship program that provides children with an education and exposure to a world that they would otherwise not have access to. The students in this program study in the fields of science and technology in cooperation with the Technion University in Haifa. Following graduation from CHW Nahalal, these children go on to study at the Technion and receive a degree in engineering. The seven year program promotes higher education, paving the way to successful futures for these children. 
In recent years, CHW has supported many projects at CHW Nahalal. CHW established the MAHUT Centre which is designed to help children with learning disabilities. CHW supported the building and furnishing of the Anieres Dormitory, which houses the children who are taking part in both the Na'aleh and the Anieres Programs. CHW Nahalal is also home to the Dan Auditorium. Marla and Aubrey Dan have generously provided funding for recent major renovations and updates to the auditorium, which is truly a state-of-the-art facility. With generous support from Gloria Rosenberg, CHW has renewed the Dairy Farm, maintaining the youth village's connection to its agricultural roots. This year, with thanks to the Palmer family, Dormitory Vav will be renovated in order to provide comfortable and up to date housing for more children in need.

  <h3>CHW HADASSIM CHILDREN AND YOUTH VILLAGE</h3>
  <p class="about_desc">CHW Hadassim Children and Youth Village, located east of Netanya and north of Tel Aviv, was founded in 1947 for European Jewish refugee children. CHW Hadassim is one of the largest residential schools in Israel. Today, CHW Hadassim serves both immigrant and Israeli children from disadvantaged families. 

The Youth Village has a regional high school for over 1,700 students in grades 7 to 12, with over 300 children living on campus in "family units" and dormitories. Students living in these residences arrive as early as age six, and study at the primary school in the area. Younger children are cared for by "foster parents," who work closely with the biological parents, to help maintain the integrity of the family. Many children living at CHW Hadassim come from families unable to protect and care for them, having experienced emotional, sexual and physical abuse as well as neglect. The "family unit" offers emotional support in a nurturing and warm environment.  The vibrant surroundings at CHW Hadassim help these children to feel at home and to excel in their studies. 

CHW Hadassim is home to the Na’aleh Program. Currently, this program is comprised of over 120 children from France, Latin America, and Russia. The program is designed for children who are seeking refuge from their native countries, due to the global rise of anti-Semitism, political instability, and financial challenges. Classes are taught in the student's home country language.

In recent years, CHW has supported many new endeavors at CHW Hadassim. CHW re-built dormitory Hey, now named The Claudia Goldman Dormitory, with the generous support of the Goldman family, to house children from the Na'aleh Program. Most recently the Eunice Mouckley Therapeutic Centre, was built, offering a comprehensive treatment program facility for children and families in dire need of support.

<h3>CHW NETANYA TECHNOLOGICAL HIGH SCHOOL</h3>
<p class="about_desc">Established in 1972, CHW Netanya Technological High School began as a Youth Aliyah study centre maintained by the Jewish Agency of Israel. In 1997, CHW Netanya Technological School came under the direction of the Netanya Municipality and the Ministry of Education. 

Today, CHW Netanya Technological High School provides over 160 students with the opportunity to acquire an education in an accredited vocation, preparing them for a bright future. The school updated their vocational programs to better prepare their graduates for successful employment. Students learn vocations from a wide range of occupations, including hairdressing, patisserie, business management, automotive mechanics, hotel management and hosting, media and communications and recently, the world-renowned CISCO computer-programming course. It is a long school day for these students, and a hot meal is provided for them at lunchtime. 

Through CHW’s support, select students participate in the March of the Living trip which affords these students a once-in-a-lifetime experience in Poland and Israel. Similarly, others benefit from the Transportation Program, ensuring they are able to safely attend school.

In recent years, CHW has supported renovations for new program streams. With the generous support of Marla and Aubrey Dan, and Debbie Eisenberg and Gary Levene, the Patisserie Stream classrooms were updated to state-of-the-art facilities. The Management Stream has been transformed into an advanced and modern facility, with thanks to Marilyn Libin. This year, CHW is renovating the school’s gymnasium.  </p>

		<h3>HADASSAH HOSPITAL</h3>
		<p class="about_desc">Hadassah-Ein Kerem was founded by Hadassah, the Women’s Zionist Organization of America, when its original hospital on Mt. Scopus became inaccessible following Israel’s 1948 War of Independence. In the ensuing years, Hadassah continued to treat the people of Jerusalem in an assortment of makeshift facilities scattered throughout the city. With no immediate prospect of returning to Mt. Scopus, the women of Hadassah dedicated themselves to building a modern medical campus in the quiet suburb of Ein Kerem which opened in 1961. In 1990, CHW affiliated with Hadassah International and became the sole representative of Hadassah Hospital in Canada. Today, the extensive campus of Hadassah University Medical Center at Ein Kerem contains over 25 buildings, including outstanding research facilities and the schools of medicine, nursing, dentistry, and public health. Currently, Hadassah Hospital serves a population of approximately one million people.

Hadassah Hospital deals with virtually every conceivable aspect of modern medicine and serves as a national referral centre for the most complex and challenging medical cases. With more than 130 departments and clinics, Hadassah-Ein Kerem provides the most advanced diagnostic and therapeutic services as well as attending to the daily needs of local, national, and international patients. Hadassah Hospital is also proud to be the home to the world famous Chagall windows.

Over the years, CHW has supported many undertakings at Hadassah Hospital including the CHW Fertility Unit, the establishment and equipping of the Lower-Level Operating Rooms to protect from conventional, biological, and chemical warfare, and most recently, two Nursing Control Centres
